MSNB.S. is right! https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/a-ukrainian-drone-pilot-described-an-attack-on-the-russian-navy-being-ruined-when-elon-musk-cut-his-starlink-access/ar-AA1mm3DW?ocid=msedgdhp&amp;pc=U531&amp;cvid=6ad057111b5442db9a3b4b6f9a4c44f5&amp;ei=35 

I love Microsoft, what it stands for. But I can't stand MSN News. Honestly, what the hell are you doing? Attacking Elon because the orthodoxy said so? Being Pro-Ukraine & anti Peace process to prolong the War?? Why?
